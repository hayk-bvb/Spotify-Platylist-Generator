# Spotify-Platylist-Generator
A program that streamlines the generation of a new Spotify playlist full of recommended songs, based on the input of a user's existing playlist.

IMPORTANT:
Go to https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1R0JYqXIXED6c4WoM72kluoV-G-6Khqn7, to download the zipped files, datasets, pngs, etc., and then copy them into the main project folder.


To run the program, open command prompt and terminal and enter:
python main.py --graphs-file-name=Graph_Final.pickle

This will take 3-10 minutes to load.
When using the UI, please be aware that you might have to wait several minutes sometimes and thus do not close the window to early!

Also, on your first usage, you will be redirected to a custom made website. Please copy and paste the URL of that website into the terminal and press enter, this is the Spotify API Authentication code, which will not be necessary after this.
